The Arduino script we used can be found in ArduinoScripts/UnityRead.c/UnityCom.c/UnityCom.c.ino
(yeah we accidently saved the directories with a .c file ending... and now we are too scared to change it back)
To switch between emg-controlled mode and force-controlled mode, set the useemg variable to 1 or 0 respectively

The Unity project can be found in EduExoGame/EduExo_UnityGame
All the c# scripts are written by us + all assets have been created by us. The only thing not originally created by us are the three sound effects which are downloaded from the web via https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/game/ (but we applied some effects on them to make them more fitting to the game)
